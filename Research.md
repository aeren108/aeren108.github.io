I am broadly interested in studying how properties of biological systems (molecules, cells, organs, organisms, populations) change over space and time, and what factors drive these changes. For my graduate work I am focusing on the molecular mechanisms of how cells regulate the number and type of messenger RNAs during growth and development. To study how these molecules "behave" over their lifetimes-how they move inside the cell, where they reside and what other molecules they interact with-I am currently using single molecule fluorescence microscopy to visualize these processes in living cells.

I routinely use tools of molecular biology, [single-molecule fluorescence microscopy](/assets/PIBRNAa032441 (1).pdf)and modeling for my work.  I primarily write code in Matlab and I hope to share some of my scripts on my git soon.

In the past, I have been fortunate to have been able to work with many amazing mentors and scientists. The research experiences I had during my time in [Dr. Christian Ray's](http://jcjray.com/) and [Dr. Kavita Babu's](http://www.babulab.org/home) labs have had particularly strong influences on my thought process.
