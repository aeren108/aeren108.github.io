I am broadly interested in studying mechanisms of spatio-temporal regulation in organisms, occuring at the cellular and molecular level. For my graduate work I am focusing on learning about single molecule fluorescence tools and applying them to understand eukaryotic gene regulation. 

I routinely use tools of molecular biology, microscopy, quantitative image analysis and modeling for my work. I primarily write code in Matlab.
