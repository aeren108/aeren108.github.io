# **1. FSCI 2019**

The FORCE11 Scholarly Communications Institute 2019 (August 4th-9th 2019, UCLA) was the third iteration of the summer institute that was conceived as a means to bring together the community of scholars, librarians and other stakeholders interested in open scholarly practices. I was fortunate to have received a travel scholarship to attend this year's edition. FSCI eschews the traditional conference format and instead uses [courses](https://www.force11.org/fsci/2019/course-list), discussions, keynotes and a "Do-a-thon" to start conversations around and seed action in the open scholarship movement. As a scientist-in-training, I wanted to learn about open practices in the sciences and visions for the future. Here is a summary of my notes from the five days. At the bottom are some other participants&#39; summaries and reflections.

# **2."Open" and copyright**

Closed research practices make the products of research unavailable to the reader by making the end products inaccessible (behind paywalls) or non-reproducible (because they withhold or insufficiently describe/share key methodological or auxiliary information). Open publication practices in addition to redressing these limitations of closed access publishing, also encourage less restrictive licensing and copyright barriers. In the course "[Understanding Copyright: Vital Skills for Navigating Scholarly Communications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_JBuusuZiUW3xqkl-WiU-mZkDGdQDxiOic5RZ_82PQ/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)" by Heather Briston and Martin Brennan, we discussed over two sessions the basics of U.S. Copyright Law, its applicability to research items and open access licenses.

These aren't issues I have to think about in the life sciences, but of the several important things I learnt, the one that was emphasized many times over the course was not to sign away my rights to reuse my published writings. This seemed like a common-sense cautionary, and like most common-sense-sounding advice is always relevant: don&#39;t click through contracts if you don't want to give away your rights to your work!

# **3.Scientific publishing today, and the scientific paper of the future.**

2012 marked the 350<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first academic paper (Rallison 2015). A comparison between the format of [Maxwell's original publication](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/FSCI-2019/01-getting-started.html) in _Philosophical Transactions_ and a typical scientific paper today reveals few differences in structure or elements (think text, figures, tables, equations, references and endnotes). The use of a static document styled after handwritten letters is an "underwhelming use of today's technology" It also is clear to anyone who has read and/or published papers in the sciences that the scientific paper can be improved upon. How can we reimagine the scientific paper to bring it into the 21st century and build into it principles of open access and reproducibility? Enter the research compendium.

In the course "Author Carpentry: Writing a Research Compendium and the Future of Scientific Reporting" by Donna Wrublewski and Tom Morrell we discussed the features of the scientific paper, as a step towards first defining and then learning to build a &quot;research compendium&quot;. A [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) is a "findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable/reproducible" (FAIR) digital document. We read [How to Read a Research Compendium](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09525) and then had a video call with the author Daniel Nüst. And over four days we built our own [research compendia](https://ameyajalihal.github.io/FSCI2019_doc/) (I am still excited about the result, a month on!).

In the final discussions in the class we all agreed that research compendia and similar ideas are fantastic alternatives to the old static format, but the major issue that stands in the way of its widespread adoption is the typical inertia of academicians to and to a lesser extent, that of publishers.
 
The course was fantastic, and was my first [carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) experience. I can&#39;t recommend this format enough for any coding-based teaching.

# **4. The future of the scientific communication**

While the Author Carpentry was a nice introduction to thinking about using technology to improve on the scientific paper, the course on &quot;The Scientific Paper of the Future&quot; by Deborah Khider and Daniel Garijo took a broader approach to examining the elements of STEM research in the context of improving reproducibility, metadata publishing and data sharing practices.

We talked about the played around with the what the instructors termed the components of open science:

*1.* Shared repositories like Zenodo and GitHub for sharing data, code, pipelines, etc.

*2.* Persistent unique identifiers such as DOIs, RRIDs and ORCID.

*3.* Licenses, to ensure that your work is adequately protected, even as open and FAIR practices allow you to maximize citations.

I left this course with a deeper appreciation of the different elements that constitute open science and how they can, together increase the value of academic science publishing and communication.

# **5."Imagine what you could achieve if you were 10% more brave"**

FSCI2019 was a wonderful way to make new friends from all over the world who were all deeply passionate about scholarly communication. Apart from engaging conversations with librarians, graduate students and researchers on how to implemement FAIR principles at the institutional level in STEM fields I was also able to get a glimpse into the vast worlds of STS scholars and reprodicubility practices in the humanities. To tie up all these themes, Juan Pablo Alperin from the ScholComm lab in his keyote talk on the last day described the results of his work that suggest that while scientists care about the value of open science, they don’t believe other people in their field do and that this is the major limiting factor in widespread acceptance of open access ideas. While sobering, this conclusion motivates all the work that remains to be done in the field of scholarly communication.
