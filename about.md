Welcome! Ameya is a third year Cell and Molecular Biology graduate student at the University of Michigan. Under the mentorship of Dr. Nils Walter, Ameya is using single-molecule fluoescence microscopy tools to study the mechanisms and kinetics of protein translation in cultured cells.

Outside the lab, Ameya enjoys coffee and classical Indian music (like a true Chennai native), cooking, being outdoors and thinking about representation and identity.
