Welcome! Ameya is third year Cell and Molecular biology graduate student at the University of Michigan. Under the mentorship of Dr. Nils Walter, Ameya is using single molecule microscopy tools to study the mechanisms and kinetics of protein translation in cultured cells.

Outside that lab, Ameya enjoys coffee and classical Indian music (like a true Chennai native), cooking and being outdoors.
