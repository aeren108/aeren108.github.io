Welcome! I am a third year Cell and Molecular Biology graduate student at the University of Michigan. For my PhD work, I am using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy tools to study protein translation in cancer cells under the mentorship of [Prof. Nils Walter](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/walter-lab/).

Outside the lab, I enjoys coffee and classical Indian music (like a true Chennai native), cooking, being outdoors and thinking about representation and identity.

Say hello at ameyapj at umich dot edu.
